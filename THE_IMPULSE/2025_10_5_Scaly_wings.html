                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">60 Minutes episode</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in which Anderson Cooper visits a forest in Mexico where the Monarchs end up after their long journey; they line the trees like bark and leaves themselves, and when Cooper and the guide are quiet, all you can here is the flapping of butterfly wings</span></p>            </div>

                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have been trying to reconcile my love for butterflies as something more than vanity. They are so delightfully pretty, how they contrast with the open sky and dance with delicacy. But there must be more to it, right? Am I so shallow? I&rsquo;m sure by looking at the Monarchs I could manufacture some great logic of my admiration for their generational Odyssey. Monarchs, after spending the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">winter</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Central Mexico, embark on a trek of thousands of miles and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple generations</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to northern North America where, by the end of summer, their progeny will make the trip back south. Over and over again for, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">as far as we can tell</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">a really long time</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We don&rsquo;t know precisely how the Monarchs know </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">how or when</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to migrate. And we know that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">not all Monarchs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are migratory. But generation after generation of butterflies complete a circle of Life, with Life defined as something more than singular mortality. But, how often do I think of the Monarchs specifically? And how often after that do I interact with them?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I see Monarchs, or any butterfly, in my backyard my eyes will glare slightly and my mouth will open in subtle awe. Truthfully, I enjoy butterflies mostly because they are striking. I enjoy their contrast and color. I enjoy all their varieties. If there&rsquo;s any depth to my love for butterflies maybe it&rsquo;s this: they are a fragile beauty. I once visited the butterfly garden at</span><a href="https://fairchildgarden.org/visit/wings-of-the-tropics/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Fairchild Botanical Gardens</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://fairchildgarden.org/visit/wings-of-the-tropics/"> in Miami</a>. It is an enclosed glass dome, adjacent to a cafe. To enter the garden, you must enter through an air lock, of the sort you think about only in space ships. The purpose is to ensure no butterflies escape containment. Were they prisoners? Before you enter the second door of the airlock, you are reminded, by a sign plastered to the door, to watch your step. Butterflies, the sign tells you, are everywhere, and are prone to being squashed. You walk through the garden and see butterflies doing butterfly things. You will encounter many plaques telling you the names of these butterflies, and you will forget their names. But you will remember their colors against the glass of the greenhouse ceilings. And you will remember them perched on flowers, slowly opening then closing their wings like the laziest of fans. And you will remember looking down as you walk, dutifully looking out for grounded butterflies, and seeing those few unfortunate ones regardless of the warnings.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I enjoyed the tour around the garden, but I breathed a little easier outside the airlock. How miraculous are butterflies? Creatures of rebirth with wings lighter than air. So utterly reliant on outside factors, so </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">vulnerable to change</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. How precious to experience their presence.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Growing up, I was told the visiting monarch was my Grandmother, come to check in on us. We have housed chrysalises in our garden, kept them in little tanks to watch as they change. I have seen the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">gorgeous gold filament</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sealing the caterpillar from the outside. I have seen beautiful wings unfurl, dry and take off. And I have seen weak wings droop and wither, never leaving the ground. How precious to see all of it</span></p>
