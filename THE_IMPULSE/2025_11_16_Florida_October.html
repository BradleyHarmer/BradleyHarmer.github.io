                <p>Reading&nbsp;<em>Travels With Charley&nbsp;</em>while on a shady park bench on a particularly pleasant Florida October afternoon</p>
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The American author John Steinbeck had this to say about Florida in his travelogue, &ldquo;Travels With Charley&rdquo;:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I went farther and farther north and it got colder I was aware of more and more advertising for Florida real estate and, with the approach of the long and bitter winter, I could see why &ldquo;Florida&ldquo; is a golden word. As I went along, I found that more and more people lusted toward Florida and that thousands had moved there and more thousands wanted to and would. The advertising, with a side look at Federal Communications, made few claims except for the fact that the land they were selling was in Florida. Some of them went out on a limb and promised that it was above tide level. But that didn&rsquo;t matter; the very Florida carried the message of warmth and ease and comfort. It was irresistible.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&rsquo;ve lived in good climate, and it bore the hell out of me. I like weather rather than climate. In Cuernavaca, Mexico, where I want to live, lived, and where the climate is as near to perfect as is conceivable, I have found that when people leave there they usually go to Alaska. I&rsquo;d like to see how long an Aroostook countryman can stand Florida. The trouble is that with his savings moved and invested there, he can&rsquo;t very well go back. His dice are rolled and can&rsquo;t be picked up again. But I do wonder if a down-Easter, sitting on a nylon-and-aluminum chair out on a changelessly green lawn slapping mosquitoes in the evening of Florida October &mdash; I do wonder if the stab of memory doesn&rsquo;t strike him high in the stomach just below the ribs where it hurts. And then the humid ever-summer I dare his picturing mind not to go back to the shout of color, to the clean rasp of frosty air, to the smell of pine wood burning and the caressing warmth of kitchens. For how can one know color in perpetual green, and what good is warmth without cold to give it sweetness?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides my feelings of monstrous inadequacy by putting my own writing next to Steinbeck&rsquo;s, there are three things you should know about me: John Steinbeck is possibly my favorite author, I have lived in Florida my whole life, my favorite month is October. So perhaps you can imagine the mix of feelings that arose within me as I read this passage. The worst thing? I can&rsquo;t necessarily disagree with his sentiment. Living in Florida can and does feel like living in a sweaty, eclipsing ever-summer. But I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s just my rosy nostalgia that fuels my love for Florida&rsquo;s Fall. There is something special about living through the Eternal Green and wavy rays of heat and sun and making it to the day when the weather changes &mdash; and Florida does have weather. A Floridian becomes an expert in subtlety; they can smell the coming of an afternoon storm and they will feel it on the wind when the many months of heat is about to break, and the specter of Florida October builds.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here, I can&rsquo;t help but use my nostalgia in my argument. My childhood is full of memories of Summer. It was always when we were most active as a Family &mdash; trips to the Florida Keys and almost every beach in the State, natural springs and chlorine pools. I was blessed to have such an active youth, but I always secretly waited for Fall. It&rsquo;s hard to explain; there would always be a day when the weather would turn. 86 would become 82. And that may be laughable to many, but what an indescribable difference it makes. The whole contour of the world changes &mdash; smells become earthier and mellowed, the air dries up as much as is allowed, and the people return. I wasn&rsquo;t alone in this love; my father would call this change &ldquo;camping weather&rdquo;, and indeed we camped &mdash; across the many state parks that still clung to the forests, lakes, and springs of Old Florida. How novel it felt to wear a sweatshirt and step on the crunch of fallen leaves. And of course, &ldquo;Winter&rdquo; would come, and it would even get cold for a day or two, but I always treasured those few weeks of Florida steeped in the molasses of cooler places.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a certain flavor of disdain, or more charitably, distrust in Steinbeck&rsquo;s words that I recognize and even sympathise with. If you have spent any time in Florida you will have heard the term &ldquo;Snow Bird&rdquo;, and you may have even been called one yourself. These are the sorts of people Steinbeck is describing &mdash; those who migrate explicitly to avoid weather. It struck me that as early as 1960, when this book was written, this idea of Northerners fleeing the cold for the idyllic Florida was ubiquitous enough to see strong feelings develop in those hardy enough to winter in the north. But to me, there has been a crucial shift; snow birds used to stay &mdash; my grandparents were former snow birds, their original nests in Pennsylvania before they migrated permanently to South Florida.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is much different to the nomadic group of Affluents who are notably absent during the months of Dead Summer. There is of course one obvious factor of this change &mdash; Summer has gotten hotter. July and August are peppered with heat advisories and UV indexes of 9 or 10. It is perilous to be outside and it&rsquo;s not hard to imagine things were much more bearable in the 1960s. So, those of us who are here for all 365 days have gotten used to the revolution of ever older and ever richer folks from the North who make their way back to their wintering nests every Fall. And how can I blame them when I love this same time of year? But to Steinbeck's point, perhaps there&rsquo;s something to the struggle of weather.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those Snow Birds never have to imagine better days when they can just follow the national median across latitudes. But the full-time Floridian and the Wisconsinite face the same prospect from opposite poles; where I dread the oppression of the sun and weight of the humid air, I never have to experience the blank white winters and biting gales of wind. But the tantalizing reward is the same for us both &mdash; after months of toil arrives a pleasure of temperance.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I will continue to revere Florida October for as long as I live here, or as long as it is recognizable to me &mdash; this season&rsquo;s October felt particularly warmer than I&rsquo;m used to. I will revel in the memories it evokes in me, of leaf piles on fresh green grass, of sweatshirts on the sandy shore of the Atlantic, of a slowness that drips through my hands and absorbs itself in dry soil, hibernating until the next first cold front. I have never experienced a hard winter; I have seen and tasted fresh snow but I have never de-iced my car before work. Maybe because of this there is something missing in my experience, but I know what it means to long for the relief of the elements, and I know the sweetness of Fall.</span></p>
